            <p>Some of the best films of all time are those whose different strengths all work in concert to create a
                unified,
                engrossing whole.
                The Shining,
                The Social Network,
                and Jaws are all excellent examples of films made up of strong individual parts complementing each other
                to
                form a fantastic work of art.
                That is absolutely true of God of War – its musical score elevates story moments, which flow seamlessly
                into
                fantastic action gameplay,
                which facilitates exploration and puzzles that reward you with a deeper understanding of its characters
                and
                its expansive and beautiful world.
                God of War is a masterful composition of exceptional interlocking parts,
                deliberate in its design and its foreshadowing,
                which pays off in unexpected ways in both the gameplay and story.
            </p>
            <p>Set in a new, Norse mythology-inspired world and starring a familiar but thoughtfully reimagined
                character,
                God of War’s fish-out-of-Greek-water tale is a nonstop whirlwind of emotions.
                It’s all framed by one continuous camera shot that never cuts away or takes the focus off of the heart
                of it
                all: Kratos’ relationship with his young son,
                Atreus. But the story also encompasses an indelible supporting cast,
                a gorgeous world consistently rewarding to explore,
                and immensely satisfying combat.
            </p>


            <p>God of War works from minute one thanks to the simplicity of its plot.
                Kratos and Atreus – who start as,
                at best,
                acquaintances – begin their journey having just gone through the loss of Kratos’ wife,
                whom Atreus bonded with much more than his father.
                The two set out to the tallest point in all the realms to carry out her final wishes.

                The setup is Journey-like in its visual nature – I saw the peak in the distance and knew I’d get there
                eventually – but as similar stories have taught me,
                the path is never a straight or easy one. A number of obstacles,
                both natural and god-made,
                extend the adventure to around 25 hours’ worth of terrifying threats,
                beginning with the first major encounter in the opening hours.
            </p>

            <p>If you’ve played the previous games in the series – seven of them, counting two PSP games and one mobile
                game
                – you know that Kratos lived a long life of loss,
                triumph, and plenty of god-killing in ancient Greece.
                While that history certainly informs who he is now,
                the character we encounter here has started a new chapter,
                having found love,
                a family, and a full bushy beard in this world of Norse mythology. But he is still a stranger to this
                place,
                and is forced to rely on the son he barely connects with to decipher its languages and guide him when
                the
                swing of an axe or the imprint of his boot on an undead foe won’t do the trick.

            <p>
                That relationship, and how it evolves and changes over the course of the story, is one of God of War’s
                most
                captivating qualities. Here are two people with demonstrably different personalities,
                one of them young and still innocent, the other old and as blood-soaked as they come,
                both grieving over the same woman in different ways.
                Kratos loves his son but is cold at first. He seems disappointed in his lack of skill and stomach for
                combat,
                referring to him mostly as “Boy,” and rarely making eye or physical contact with him.(He will, of
                course,
                unflinchingly beat the life out of anyone who threatens his son,
                which appears to be the only way he knows how to express affection.) Kratos’ uncertainty of how to
                relate to
                a boy he’s both looking to turn into a survivor and yet afraid may turn out like him is devastating to
                watch.
            </p>
            Their dichotomy plays out in stirring,
            realistic moments throughout the story.
            I was surprised by how often I saw myself in both Kratos and Atreus’ well-worn shoes.
            I’ve told important people in my own life some of the very things they say to each other,
            and I’ve thought (but been too afraid to speak aloud) many others,
            making God of War’s relationships feel real and cuttingly honest.
            Other games have tackled parent-child relationships,
            but I can’t remember a father-son dynamic so successfully developed and used to ground a fantastical
            adventure.
