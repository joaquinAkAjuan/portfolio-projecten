            <p>It is still unbelievable to me that after 26 years of linear,
                straightforward RPGs, developer Game Freak really looked Pok√©mon players dead in the eye and said,
                ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, go wherever you want.‚Äù In the lead-up to the launch of Pok√©mon Scarlet and Violet,
                I thought this claim would end up being a marketing gimmick, a little joke,
                something we‚Äôd all be mad about later.
                But from the moment I left the hallowed halls of Uva Academy, that promise has been wonderfully
                fulfilled,
                with open-world, open-ended gameplay serving as a shining beacon for the future of this beloved
                franchise.
                And yet,
                a finger on the cursed Mankey‚Äôs paw has curled anyway ‚Äì Scarlet and Violet‚Äôs wonderfully innovative
                design
                is dramatically undermined by the numerous ways in which they feel deeply unfinished,
                with issues ranging from an incomplete world to massive and ubiquitous technical problems.
                So even though I want to celebrate how this generation reinvents and reinvigorates the world of Pok√©mon,
                I can‚Äôt without putting a great big warning label on it.
            </p>
            <p>The actual act of playing Pok√©mon Scarlet and Violet is some of the most fun Pok√©mon has ever been,
                thanks to Game Freak‚Äôs commitment to a truly open world. From the second you leave the school after the
                tutorial,
                you can run all the way to late-game areas full of powerful trainers and Gym Leaders, catch high-level
                Pok√©mon,
                and make the adventure very difficult and rewarding for yourself accordingly.
                For anyone worried about accidentally leaping into a too-difficult area,
                fear not: Paldea is largely arranged to be friendly to those looking for a more gradual challenge,
                and even moreso is designed just right for getting pleasantly lost, backtracking,
                and wandering off the beaten route.
            </p>


            <p>Given that there‚Äôs no level scaling at play (as is Pok√©mon tradition),
                exploring Paldea at a steady but unguided pace will somewhat inevitably have you encountering foes that
                are
                either extra challenging or too easy at different points.
                Running up against a trainer who‚Äôs just a few levels higher than you can be a blast,
                especially when an unexpected Pok√©mon on your team comes in clutch to get the win and earn a giant pile
                of
                EXP.
                I had multiple tense moments against Team Star especially,
                like when their giant car Pok√©mon nearly decimated my slightly underleveled team as I pushed down a more
                challenging road.

                But even when I briefly ran roughshod over several areas in a row because I‚Äôd outleveled them,
                I didn‚Äôt find it dull. With roughly 400 different Pok√©mon species available,
                I was still enjoying poking around the lower-level areas and finding monsters I hadn‚Äôt seen yet, and
                those
                discoveries were rewarding even when the battles weren‚Äôt.
                It‚Äôs a process made especially delightful by how silly and clever many of the new Pok√©mon designs are
                this
                generation, like the apparently edible Lechonk,
                or the absurd not-actually-Diglett eel Wiglett. The monster behavior is much improved too, as I loved
                stumbling upon flocks of Starly,
                Magikarp flopping on the shoreline, Hoppip floating nervously out of the rain,
                or herds of Deerling protected by a kingly Sawsbuck.
                With so many monsters to see,
                it was wonderfully easy to get lost and distracted in the enormous ‚Äúareas‚Äù ‚Äì Scarlet and Violet‚Äôs
                replacement for routes.
            </p>

            <p>Moving across the grassy plains and rocky deserts of the land of Paldea is made easier thanks to a
                legendary
                Pok√©mon you obtain right at the start that‚Äôs determined by whether you are playing Scarlet or Violet.
                Either
                way,
                this Pok√©mon can be used as a bike and is upgraded with new movement options through one of the three
                main
                storylines.
                The dash, climb, and swimming upgrades are all helpful for crossing big Paldean expanses quickly,
                but one of those upgrades is a glide ability that can‚Äôt hold a candle to the one we got earlier this
                year in
                Legends: Arceus.
                It‚Äôs better than nothing, but I‚Äôm disappointed by the way you almost immediately lose altitude when
                gliding,
                dashing my dream of jumping from atop the highest mountain and soaring across the whole map.

            <p>
                The realization that almost the entirety of Scarlet and Violet are their interconnected outdoor zone is
                even
                more pronounced when you look closely at the detail that is there.
                Towns are all unique, colorful, and full of personality.
                Each one has distinct buildings and landmarks,
                like Artazon‚Äôs windmill or Porto Marinada‚Äôs fishing docks,
                and there‚Äôs clearly been a lot of thought put into modeling them after diverse and specific locations in
                and
                around real-world Spain. But for the most part,
                that‚Äôs where the thoughtfulness ends. Most buildings are facades you can‚Äôt enter, with nothing to do
                around
                them. Most stores are just menus you open when you interact with the door, and the biggest cities have
                the
                same storefronts repeated over and over. To give an example, in one city I was excited to run into what
                was
                clearly a warehouse for in-game store chain Delibird Presents ‚Äì it looked like a warehouse, had the
                logo,
                and everything. I expected I‚Äôd be able to go inside, and that there might be workers, a sidequest,
                vendors,
                or something unique in there. But it was just an unopenable box.
                Someone put enough thought into the world to imagine this company would have a headquarters in the town
                I
                was in, but the idea went no further.
            </p>
            That blankness unfortunately extends to many of the NPCs scattered around the world, too.
            Older Pok√©mon games are dotted with characters who would engage in short conversations with you about
            gameplay
            tips,
            Pok√©mon, world lore, or just goofy one-liners that gave them personality. I wouldn‚Äôt say that element is
            absent
            from Scarlet and Violet,
            but it‚Äôs certainly lessened, almost like someone ran out of time to write interesting dialogue for all these
            people walking laps around their towns.
            A lot of the trainer and bystander NPC dialogue is roughly on the level of ‚ÄúI like Pok√©mon!‚Äù,
            while the more in-depth explanations of the world are relegated to classes you can take at the school.
            Don‚Äôt get me wrong: I love the classes and the ways in which they manage to build Scarlet and Violet‚Äôs lore
            while also tutorializing things about Pok√©mon even I didn‚Äôt know after decades engrossed in the series.
            But it‚Äôs strange that the NPC department has suffered so much when the writing in the central storylines is
            otherwise stellar,
            especially given that the main cast of characters are some of the most interesting Pok√©mon‚Äôs had in a while.
